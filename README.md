# cargo-raze

A bazel rule generator for cargo dependencies.

The syntax generated by this tool is completely imaginary. No `new_crate_repository` repository rule currently exists in `rules_rust`, and there are likely syntactic errors in the generated WORKSPACE and BUILD files.

## Example invocation

```
cargo run --raze ./cargo/ --overrides log-0.3.7:@custom-log//log:log
```

WORKSPACE file yielded into `./cargo/`
